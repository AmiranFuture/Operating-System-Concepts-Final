helloworld module: 
This is a simple module to demonstrate the implementation and removal of modules in the Linux Kernel. 
As you can see in the screenshots, when we activate it, the message "Hello, Kernel!" appears in the Kernel Log (dmesg). 
This means that the module has been successfully activated. To deactivate it, we write the rmmod helloworld command and again go to the 
Kernel Log and see the farewell message "Goodbye, Kernel!"

devnum module:
When there is a device and a driver, then how to connect them together, you can do it using this module. This module creates a number 
for a specific device in ls/dev. You can see this on the example of the test file "test.c". The screenshots show the successful launch 
of the module and the test file, as well as the deactivation of the module and a "exit" message.
