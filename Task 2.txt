Task 2: use 3 methods connection to ethernet

NAT connection:
1)In VirtualBox you need to select your virtual machine

2)Then open the settings

3)In the opened window on left bar select “Networks”

4)Choose “Adapter 1” and make a note to the “Enable networks adapter”

5)Then in the type of connection choose “NAT”

6)Then click “OK” buttom and you can start your VM and ping any site from terminal




Via proxy server connection: 
1)Firstly you need to install squid lib using that command: sudo apt-get install squid

2)Next you need open squid configuration file with nano or vim using that command: nano /etc/squid/squid.conf (it’s a address of squid.conf location)

3)And in the opened txt editor you need to make changes below:
http_port 3128 (it’s a default port)
acl localnet src 192.168.1.2(instead of these ip you need write your network address)
http_access allow localnet

4)Then save and close the file

5)Next you need to update the squid to confirm the changes with that command: 
sudo service squid restart 

6)Now we need to configure VM to use that proxy in the VM settings, open VM settings and on the left navigate bar choose “Network”, then click on 
the Network Proxy settings and choose “Manual” and instead of given ip write there your proxy ip and port, in our example “192.168.1.2” and “3128”, then close all settings 

7)Congratulations, its done. Now you can check it by open browser and it will work by your proxy
